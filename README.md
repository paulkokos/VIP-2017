Robust and reliable traffic sign detection is necessary to bring autonomous vehicles onto our roads. State of the art traffic sign detection algorithms in the literature successfully perform the task over existing databases that mostly lack realistic road conditions. This competition focuses on detecting such traffic signs under challenging conditions.<br/>

To facilitate such task and competition, we introduce a novel video dataset that contains a variety of road conditions. In such video sequences, we vary the type and the level of the challenging conditions including a range of lighting conditions, blur, haze, rain and snow levels. The goal of this challenge is to implement traffic sign detection algorithms that can robustly perform under such challenging environmental conditions.<br/>

Any eligible team can participate in the competition, whose detailed guidelines and dataset are planned to be released on March 15, 2017 and participating teams should complete their submission by July 1, 2017. The three best teams are selected and announced by August 1, 2017. Three finalist teams will be judged at ICIP 2017, which will be held September 17-20, 2017. In addition to algorithmic performances, demonstration and presentation performances will also affect the final ranking.<br/>

The champion team will receive a grand prize of $5,000. The first and the second runner-up will receive a prize of $2,500 and $1,500, respectively, in addition to travel grants and complimentary conference registrations. Each finalist team invited to ICIP 2017 will receive travel grant supported by the SPS on a reimbursement basis. A team member is offered up to $1,200 for continental travel, or $1,700 for intercontinental travel. A maximum of three members per team will be eligible for travel support.<br/>
